        Training a deep learning neural network is similar to a professor
        training a student for an exam. Initially, the professor gathers the
        syllabus and splits it into a training part and a test part. The student
        is trained on the training material and is then subjected to the test.
        Based on the test results, the professor calculates the score and
        suggests that the student minimize their errors. Similarly, in deep
        learning, a model is trained on a dataset and then evaluated on a test
        set, with adjustments made to minimize the loss function.

        The crux of machine and deep learning is to take data, build an
        algorithm(neural network) to discover deep patterns in it and use the
        discovered patterns to generate new data.

        There are many ways to design this process. We start from the very
        basic; which is predicting a straight line. We will see if we can build
        a PyTorch model that learns the patterns of straight line and matches
        it.
